FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

To stave off some general questions, here is a FAQ...

1 Q. Why bundle everything.
  A. To make the install easier, by installing a single package.

2 Q. Why the enhancements to the code H::T module?
  A. The most requested features have been merged in, such as support for
     TMPL_ELSIF and the ability to sub-class.

3 Q. What not just update HTML::Template and HTML::Template::Expr?
  A. Some features require modification to the underlying library, while
     others can be implemented elsewhere, thus providing some seperation
     or core-logic from enhancements.

4 Q. What about other templating packages?
  A. You make your own choices... this package is based on what I wanted
     from H::T, without having to install Template::Toolkit.

5 Q. What not merge upstream?
  A. The community has made enhancement requests on numerous occasions.
     Since H::T core functionality does most of what is needed, it really
     is up to the core maintainer to accept patches.  In the interim,
     this package provides some of those features.
